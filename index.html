            <b>The World Happiness Score</b> is a measure of a country's population's well-being and happiness.
            <br><br>
            This score is calculated and published by the <b>United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UNSDSN)</b>.
            <br><br>
            The purpose of finding these scores is to help guide public policy and to help countries improve their overall happiness.
            <br><br>
            The final Happiness Score is formulated by combining a list of different factors, including <b>economy</b>, <b>family</b>, <b>health</b>, <b>freedom</b>, <b>government</b>, and <b>generosity scores</b>.
            These factors can be explained as following:
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <div class="description description-right">
          <p>
            <b>Economy:</b> how financially stable and well off a country is.
            <br><br>
            <b>Family:</b> the strength and supportiveness of social connections within a group, particularly within families.
            <br><br>
            <b>Health:</b> how healthy a person is.
            <br><br>
            <b>Freedom:</b> how much freedom a person has to make life choices.
            <br><br>
            <b>Government:</b> how much trust a person has in their government.
            <br><br>
            <b>Generosity:</b> the willingness of individuals to help other strangers.
          </p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <div id="choropleth" class="vis-container"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <div class="description description-left">
          <p>
            The general happiness trends of the world is that we are becoming <b style="color: blue;">increasingly unhappy</b> as shown in the choropleth map generally becoming lighter with time.
            Many attribute this rise in unhappiness to the <b style="color: blue;">silent epidemic of loneliness</b>. 
            This will become even more apparent as we increasingly engage online and have fewer physical interactions.
            <br><br>
            In addition, there are other factors that have contributed to this <b style="color: blue;">rise in unhappiness</b>, including the rise of social media, which has lead to a rise in social comparison.
            <br><br>
            However, <b style="color: #4682B4">Scandinavian countries</b> consistently lead in overall happiness score.
            This can be attributed to the fact that while they may not always top each of the individual factors, they consistently achieve high scores across the board.
            One particularly noteworthy factor is their <b>family score</b>, which indicates that there is a high level of trust between citizens, leading to better social cohesion. 
            Many have suggested that this sense of commumnity and trust has lead to a better overall happiness score.

        <div class="description description-right">
          <p>
            While the world happiness score does trend downwards, there are some outliers:
            <br><br> 
            1. While the highest <b>economy score</b> danced around 1.7, in 2018, the <b style="color: #228B22">United Arab Emirates (UAE)</b> had a score of 2.10. 
            This can be attributed to an increase in oil prices and robust growth in other sectors.
            <br><br> 
            2. While the rest of the world struggles with <b>government trust</b>, and especially being surrounded by countries with the <b>lowest government scores</b>, 
            <b style="color: #228B22">Rwanda</b> excels in this aspect. This can be attributed to the fact that Rwanda has a very stable government, with low levels of corruption.
            In addition, under the leadership of President Paul Kagame, Rwanda has seen a lot of economic growth and development, which has led to a high level of trust in the government.
            <br><br>
            3. While the rest of the world struggles with <b>generosity</b>, <b style="color: #D62828">Myanmar</b> has consistently held a very high generosity score, peaking at 0.84 in 2017.
            This can be attributed to the strong Buddhist culture in Myanmar, which emphasizes generosity and giving. 
            This is reflected in the vast majority of residents donating to charity and volunteering.

            For the highest scoring regions of <b style="color: #9932CC">Oceania</b> and <b style="color: #B87333">North America</b>,
            they remain consistently high across all other factors, staying in their own tier.

            This is also true for every region for the categories of economy, <b>family</b> and <b>health</b>.

            they take a dive for the categories of <b>freedom</b>, <b>government</b> and <b>generosity</b>.
            <br><br>
            Instead, the bottom regions of <b style="color: #D62828">Asia</b> and <b style="color: #228B22">Africa</b> take their place.

            There is a time old saying of "Money can't buy happiness", but is this really true?
            <br><br>
            From the trends from the chart to the left, from 2015 to 2017, the world's economy score has been increasing. 
            This can be attributed to <b>low oil prices</b>, improving productivity, resulting in a more prosperous world.
            However, in <b>2018</b>, the <b>oil prices have risen</b>. This subsequently caused the economy scores across the world to drop. 
            However <b style="color: #228B22">United Arab Emirates (UAE)</b>, as a world leader in oil production, has seen a dramatic rise in their economy score.
            <br><br>
            In the chart to the left, the highest scoring country for happiness and economy is annotated. 
            There are many instances where a country's economy score increases but their happiness score decreases.
            Therefore, it can be concluded that money does not alone impact happiness. There are many other factors that contribute to happiness.

            While overall, the regions in the world's happiness scores are relatively constant, there are some outliers.
            <br><br>
            In 2017, there was a large decline in the <b style="color: #B87333">Amer</b><b style="color: #5A2E06">icas</b> region. This decline followed in the coming years.
            This decline can be attributed to a combination of factors, including economic challenges, political instability and social unrest.
            <br><br>
            In the mean time, the <b style="color: #4682B4">European</b> region has seen a consistent increase in happiness score.
            From the "Score by Country" chart, it can be observed that this region's <b>economy, government and generosity scores have been increasing</b>, resulting in the consistent increase observed.

            In 2019 the chart depicting regional happiness scores above illustrates a <b>reduction in the difference between the highest and lowest scoring regions</b>.
            However, <b>individual country's scores can be seen to be diverging</b>.
            <br><br>
            Overall, from 2015 to 2019, a trend heading upwards can be observed.
            In 2019, the largest difference was recorded of 4.92.
            This is a <b>3.58% increase</b> from the start in 2015 and a <b>6.49% increase</b> from the lowest point in 2016.
